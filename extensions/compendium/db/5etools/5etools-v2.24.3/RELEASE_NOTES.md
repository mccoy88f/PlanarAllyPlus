- Improved initial load performance of Omnisearch _[by about 20% on my machine]_
- Fixed non-partnered content appearing in default Omnisearch index
- Fixed crash when up-arrow-ing in Dice Roller input
- Fixed filter "Include References" sources failing to populate
- Fixed DM Screen Initiative Tracker crash when changing round on an empty tracker
- (Brew) Moved artisan's tools to `"baseitem"`, such that they may benefit from `"magicvariant"`s
